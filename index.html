    <p><b>Lesson 0: HTML</b></p>
<b>World Wide Web</b><br>
-collection of HTML documents<br>-HTML - Hypertext Markup Language - main type of content<br> 
-Hyperlinks connect documents<br>
-HTTP- the main protocol of the web<br>
<p><b>HTML</b></p>
-made up of:<br>
1) text content - what you see<br>
2) markup - what it looks like<br>
3) references to other documents - e.g. images and videos<br>
4) links to other pages<br>
-plain text appears as plain text in HTML<br>
-HTML markup changes text (makes things bold, italics, etc.)<br>
<b>-tags***- (opening tag)-content-(closing tag)</b>  <br>
-  all of this is called an element<br>
examples: b - bold, em - italics<br> - if you forget to close a tag, everything after the opening tag follows the opening tag's command<br>
<p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>
- tags can have multiple attributes<br>
- opening tag contains ATTR="value", then comes the content, then regular closing tag<br>
-anchor tag - "a" - for making links<br>
-html will show the content as a clickable link to the value<br>
<br> -images tag<br> -"img" src(source)= "url"(url of the image to be downloaded) alt (alternate-if url is broken, displays this text)="text"<br>
-note: the alt is required<br>
-images do not have closing tag....these kinds of tags are called VOID tags<br>
<p><b>Whitespace</b></p>
-in HTML, all whitespace (spaces, tabs, new lines) are put on 1 line unless specific tags are used to break the lines up.<br>
-"br" tag - break - Is a VOID tag - put this after lines to break into multiple lines<br>
- inline - ends line<br>
- the "p" tag - paragraph - also breaks up lines, but is not a VOID tag, so you have to put this tag around all lines trying to be broken up<br>
- block tag - means that is makes an invisible box around the text - the box has space above and below it<br>
-"span" and "div" tags - these tags do nothing but contain content<br>
-span is an inline tag and div is a block tag<br>
<p><b>HTML Document Layout</b></p>
- note: put < > instead of ( )<br>
(!DOCTYPE HTML) - doctype<br>
(html) - opening html tag - surrounds all document content<br>
(head)<br>
(title)title!(/title) - title of page<br>
(/head) - the closing tag of the head metadata<br>
(body) - opening tag for the body, which contains the most interesting stuff<br>
(b) content (/b)<br>
(/body) - closing tag for body<br>
(/html) - closing HTML tag - surrounds document content<br>
